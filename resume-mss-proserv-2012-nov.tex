\section{Experience}

\cventry{July 2011 -- Present}{Software Engineer 4}{Juniper Networks}{}{}{}

As a software engineer at Juniper, I was responsible for feature development,
bug fixes, and project automation on the Junos Pulse Mobile Security Gateway.
The product is a cloud-based, multi-tenant, enterprise management server
responsible for managing security and usage policies on major smartphone
platforms including iOS, Android, BlackBerry, Symbian, and Windows Mobile.

My contributions in this role following integration of legacy SMobile technology
included:

\begin{itemize}

    \item A project automation system to implement continuous deployment.
        Based on the open source Jenkins continuous integration platform and the
        maven build tool, I implemented one-click and no-click processes capable
        of building, verifying, and deploying the application.
        The project included implementing a custom Maven plugin.

    \item
        Upgrading our development platform from JBoss 5 to JBoss AS 7 in order
        to take advantage of improved performance, security, and manageability.
        I was able to leverage the JBoss management API in order to automate installati
        on, configuration, and deployment of the system.

    \item
        Implementing Single Sign-On using the SAML SSO protocol and the OpenSAML
        library

\end{itemize}

2010, I was responsible for managing the integration of server technologies
and development into existing Juniper Processes.

\begin{itemize}
    \item
        Migrating legacy SMobile tools including defect tracking, source control,
        and release management tools into their Juniper equivalents.
    \item
        Training Juniper team members on the use and architecture of SMobile technology.
    \item
        Maintaining release cadence so that we could continue to deliver SMobile
        technology under the new Juniper brand.
\end{itemize}

\cventry{November 2008 -- July 2010}{Directory of Architecture}{SMobile Systems}{
}{}{}

As director of Architecture at SMobile Systems, I was responsible for the
design and delivery of the company's enterprise management server product.
In this role, I was able to manage new feature development while migrating
the system from a legacy PHP implementation to an Enterprise Java implementatio
n.

\cventry{May 2007 -- November 2008}{.NET Applications Developer}{Exceptional
Innovation}{}{}{}

I extended Life|ware's home automation scripting engine; developed new releases
of the Life| ware configuration tool, Visual Project; and developed feature
enhancements within Life|ware's service oriented architecture.

\cventry{July 2004 -- May 2007}{Vice President of Engineering}{SMobile Systems}{}

        1 mobile network operator in Europe.
    \item Designed a flexible product architecture enabling rapid customization
        for new clients and shifting requirements.
    \item Extracted and continuously refined functional specifications from vague
        and sometimes ambiguous business requirements.
\end{itemize}

\cventry{July 2004 -- May 2007}{Software Engineer}{SMobile Systems}{}{}{}

        including an Anti-Virus, an SMS and call filter, and an encryption tool
        for all major Symbian platforms.
    \item
        Automated build and deployment procedures to ensure project consistency
        among multiple developers, reducing integration delays by 75%.
