\cventry{July 2011 -- Present}{Software Engineer 4}{Juniper Networks}{}{}{}

As a software engineer at Juniper, I was responsible for feature development,
bug fixes, and project automation on the Junos Pulse Mobile Security Gateway.
The product is a cloud-based, multi-tenant, enterprise management server

platforms including iOS, Android, BlackBerry, Symbian, and Windows Mobile.

My contributions in this role following integration of legacy SMobile technology
included:

    \item A project automation system to implement continuous deployment.
        Based on the open source Jenkins continuous integration platform and the
        maven build tool, I implemented one-click and no-click processes capable
        of building, verifying, and deploying the application.
        The project included implementing a custom Maven plugin.

    \item
        Upgrading our development platform from JBoss 5 to JBoss AS 7 in order
        to take advantage of improved performance, security, and manageability.
        I was able to leverage the JBoss management API in order to automate installati
        on, configuration, and deployment of the system.
